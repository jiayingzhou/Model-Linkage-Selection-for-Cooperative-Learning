# Model-Linkage-Selection-for-Cooperative-Learning

This is the attached code of the paper: Model Linkage Selection for Cooperative Learning
There are five experiments code experiment 1- 5 that correspond to the five experiments in Section 4.

## Experiment 1

This is a synthetic linear regression example. 

## Experiment 2

This is a synthetic logistic regression example.

## Experiment 3

This is a real data example on breast-cancer-wisconsin data, the data is downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)

## Experiment 4

This is a real data example on Gene Expression Data, the data is not published, please email the authors of the paper "Bayesian data integration and variable selection for pan-cancer survival prediction using protein expression data" for permission.

## Experiement 5

This is a real data example on Plummer's example as illustrated in the paper.
